# finance_application
A finance application that I am developing for my Application Development II class using Django for Pythton

This is very much a work in progress. I plan on implementing a bunch of features but currently i am working on data collection and
user registration. Once I get this all done, I can start adding the financial stuff that needs to be implemented
for this to be considedered an actual finance app
